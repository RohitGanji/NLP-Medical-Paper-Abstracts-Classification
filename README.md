•	Engineered and trained a multimodal classifier combining NLP and structured data approaches using TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn, achieving 96% accuracy in classifying medical paper abstracts <br>
•	Employed BERT embeddings, ensemble methods to improve robustness and accuracy for complex medical text analysis
